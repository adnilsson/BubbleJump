# BubbleJump
A climber/jumping game (think Doodle Jump).

The game is hevily inspired by an old game for mobile phones (from the time when mobiles had buttons) with the same title. Arcade inspired, so the player goal is just to get as high a score as possible. Originally my final high school project that didn't finish in time. Recently rediscovered it and decided it was worth finishing. It's now my spare time project. 


## Usage

To run the game either execute the included .exe contained in the Release folder, or attempt to compile it yourself from source.

### Controls

You control the character with the left and right arrow keys. 

Other controls:
- **Space**:  Action (pause/unpause, restart on game over)
- **Esc**:    Immediately exits the game, i.e. kills the window.

### Mechanics

When you start the game the bubbles will be fairly large, and you need to hit these bubbles in order to gain momentum. Each hit bubble also gives you some points, the value of which increases with each hit bubble. Should you fall below the bottom of the screen it is game over. As you climb higher, bubbles will get smaller and eventually the spacing between bubbles will also increase (until a certain point is reached, of course). Try to climb as high  as possible and beat the high scores!

Occasionally, the fearsome [Hitlerpus](http://youtu.be/Mz3h7NdcMC4) appears. Kill him instantly and double your score.


## Requirements

The game requires DirectX to be pre-installed in order to execute. 


## Other information

Created in Visual Studio 2012, exported to and compiled in Visual Studio 2013 with DirectX SDK (June 2010).
