* Replace explicit casts with either static_cast<> or dynamic_cast<>. Used 
  in conversion between ListElements and Bubbles/RareSpawns.

* (In BubbleList.cpp::collisionCheck() fix bug) Fixed but don't know why it works. Sort it out.


* Consider saving high scores in lists instead of arrays in Parser class. This would be beneficial
  since we need to update parts of the array when a new high score has been set. (Is it worth the
  extra trouble of creating a ListElement that contains only an string/bigInteger ?)

* Implement a start menu (as an object seperate from Game).

(*) Virtual function traverseList in List.h: implement a virtual print() function for list elements.
    Generic, but not elegant because every call to traverseList would need to include all parameters
	for every version. i.e. I need to pass a font, sprite and game_state even though they're not always
	needed.
